# Boston-house-price-analysis
PROJECT STATEMENT
The idea behind this project is to build a model that will predict the price of house in boston. It is based on per capita crime rate by town, average number of rooms per dwelling, the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940, The median value of owner-occupied, etc.

APPROACH
In this research Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Support Vector Machine has been used to predict house price in boston using 14 features of homes from various suburbs located in Boston.

DATA DESCRIPTION
The dataset used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which concerns housing values in the suburbs of Boston. This data was collected in 1978 and contains 506 entries which give information about 14 attributes of homes from various suburbs located in Boston and one “target” attribute. 

MODEL SELECTION
There are various models available under regression analysis but for this paper four regression models are used which are Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Support Vector Machine on the Boston house dataset.
